## Note on Data Persistence

This application utilizes a free instance of Render.com for deployment. It's important to note that free instances on Render.com may have limitations on data persistence.

The data entered in the application may persist for a limited time but can be lost after a period of inactivity or instance restart. This is due to resource limitations and automatic cleaning policies on Render.com.

Please make sure to take necessary precautions and backup important data to avoid information loss.
